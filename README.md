#### 介绍
This repository is for holding the meta-phosphor layer from upstream: https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc.

OpenBMC
================

meta-phosphor contains core functionalities for OpenBMC systems, while other layers in OpenBMC repository
contain hardware-specific adaption and company-specific modification. Since our aim is to support
OpenBMC with openEuler Embedded, only transplant this layer is enough.
